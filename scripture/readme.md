## scripture: zines

These zines are designed to be printed on 8.5 x 11" paper. [Here's a good guide](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Zine) to folding and cutting it to make a little booklet.

If you have decently thick paper, I recommend printing the [entire system](https://github.com/alexglow/aeiu/blob/master/symbols/symbols-2019/aeiu-2019-vert.png) on the back!
